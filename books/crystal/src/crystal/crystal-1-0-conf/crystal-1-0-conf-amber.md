# Amber Framework

* Complex installation (starts by installing Crystal?)

```
curl -L https://github.com/amberframework/amber/archive/stable.tar.gz | tar xz
cd amber-stable
shards install
make install
```

* It wants to install in `/usr/local/bin/amber` why?
* There is some talk about docker-compose...
