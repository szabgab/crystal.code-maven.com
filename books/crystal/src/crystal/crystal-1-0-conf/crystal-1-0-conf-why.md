# Why?

* [module counts](http://www.modulecounts.com/)
* [3rd party registry](https://code-maven.com/package-registry)
* Listing of shards [crystalshards.xyz](https://crystalshards.xyz/) (thin wrapper around the API of GitHub)

This site listing the shards are very plain, only a thin wrapper around GitHub API
I can do a much better one analyzing shards and displaying information.
