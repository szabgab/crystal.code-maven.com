# Shards

* Easy to install (`shards install`).
* Few of them. Many common libraries (shards) are missing - harder to develop and many opportunities.
* Discover-ability (There is no `shards search`, there is no central database of shards).
* "Failed to resolve dependencies, try updating incompatible shards or use `--ignore-crystal-version` as a workaround if no update is available."
