# Append to file

* append

{% embed include file="src/examples/files/append_to_file.cr" %}


* This is a bug in my code, but it still creates the file with some strange rights `---xr-Sr--`

{% embed include file="src/examples/files/append_to_file_bug.cr" %}

* The `ameba` linter will catch this error.
