# Code formatting

* 2-space indentation is the norm.

* Use the Crystal tool to format your code:

```
crystal tool format
```

* You can also use it in a CI system to verify code-formatting
* (You can also make the CI format it for you and commit the changes back to the repository)

```
crystal tool format --check
```
