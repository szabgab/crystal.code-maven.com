# Exercise: Age limit

* Create a script called `age_limit_stdin.cr`

* Ask the user what is their age.
* If it is above 18, tell them they can legally drink alcohol.
* If is is above 21, tell them they can also legally drink in the USA.

* Extra: ask the user for their age and the name of their country and tell them if they can legally drink alcohol.
* See the [Legal drinking age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_drinking_age) list.
* Don't worry if this seems to be too difficult to solve in a nice way. We'll learn more tools to improve.
